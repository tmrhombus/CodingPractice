The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is

3025-385=2640

.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.





25164150

The difference between the square of the sum and the sum of squares in the range from 1 to 10 is 2640 = 2640.0 


The difference between the square of the sum and the sum of squares in the range from 1 to 100 is 25164150 = 25164150.0
