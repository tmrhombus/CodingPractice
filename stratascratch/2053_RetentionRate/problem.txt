ou are given a dataset that tracks user activity. The dataset includes information about the date of user activity, the account_id associated with the activity, and the user_id of the user performing the activity. Each row in the dataset represents a userâs activity on a specific date for a particular account_id.

Your task is to calculate the monthly retention rate for users for each account_id for December 2020 and January 2021. The retention rate is defined as the percentage of users active in a given month who have activity in any future month.

For instance, a user is considered retained for December 2020 if they have activity in December 2020 and any subsequent month (e.g., January 2021 or later). Similarly, a user is retained for January 2021 if they have activity in January 2021 and any later month (e.g., February 2021 or later).

The final output should include the account_id and the ratio of the retention rate in January 2021 to the retention rate in December 2020 for each account_id. If there are no users retained in December 2020, the retention rate ratio should be set to 0.
